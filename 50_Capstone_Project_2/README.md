## API

Almost all cryptocurrency APIs have extremely low daily and monthly credit limits, and because of that, it's very easy to exhaust your credit supply as a developer on a free development plan. For this reason, I've used 2 different cryptocurency APIs to gather data for my project.

- CoinMarketCap - Used for main cryptocurrency table on the homepage. - https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/
- CoinGecko - Used for gathering historical data and market information on each cryptocurrency page as well as prices of cryptocurrencies on the watchlist and the portfolio. - https://www.coingecko.com/en

Since 2 different APIs are used to gather information, sometimes the prices on the cryptocurrency table displayed on the homepage and the prices of cryptocurrencies on the watchlist and portfolio might be slightly different.
